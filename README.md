## Deploy a Node.js server to AWS EC2

**Overview**
- Deploy a simple Node.js server to EC2, using Elastic Beanstalk

- Choose a server youâ€™ve built previously
  - A simple API or Web Server
  - The server should not require a database
  - Check in your server to GitHub

- Task 1:
  - Create a new environment, using Elastic Beanstalk from the AWS Control Panel (GUI)
  - Manually deploy your application to this environment by uploading a .zip file

-Task 2:
  - Using the same server, create a new environment using Elastic Beanstalk from your terminal
  - Manually deploy your application to this environment by using eb deploy

- Task 3:
  - Automatically deploy your app to either (or both) environments on check-ins to your main branch using a github action
